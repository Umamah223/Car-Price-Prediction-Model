The repository features a machine learning model to predict car prices using a variety of features. The model created is a Linear Regression Model trained on 'train1.csv' dataset. The dataset consists information that affects the car price such as Kilometers travelled, Torque, HorsePower, Ratings, Top Speed etc..

This project is built using TensorFlow for building and model training, Pandas and Numpy
