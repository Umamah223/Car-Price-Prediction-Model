The repository features a Machine Learning Model to **predict car prices** using a variety of features. The model created is a simple **Linear Regression Model** trained on 'train1.csv' dataset. The dataset consists information that affects the car price such as *Kilometers travelled, Torque, HorsePower, Ratings, Top Speed etc*..

This project is built using **TensorFlow** for building and model training, **Pandas** and **Numpy**
